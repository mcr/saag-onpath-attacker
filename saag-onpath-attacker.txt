                  A taxonomy of eavesdropping attacks
                draft-richardson-saag-onpath-attacker-01

Abstract

   The terms on-path attacker and Man-in-the-Middle Attack have been
   used in a variety of ways, sometimes interchangeably, and sometimes
   meaning different things.

   This document offers an update on terminology for network attacks.  A
   consistent set of terminology is important in describing what kinds
   of attacks a particular protocol defends against, and which kinds the
   protocol does not.

1.  Introduction

   A number of terms have been used to describe attacks against
   networks.

   In the [dolevyao] paper, the attacker is assumed to be able to:

   *  view messages as they are transmitted

   *  selectively delete messages

   *  selectively insert or modify messages

   Some authors refer to such an attacker as an "on-path" attacker
   [reference], or a "Man-in-the-Middle" [reference].  This type of
   attack is also refered to as a "monster-in-the-middle" attack.

   Despite a broad consensus on what is meant by a MITM attack, there is
   less agreement on the how to describe its variants.  The term
   "passive attacker" has been used in many cases to describe situations
   where the attacker can only observe messages, but can not intercept,
   modify or delete any messages.

   Another variant is the case where an eavesdropper is not on the
   network path between the actual correspondants, and thus cannot drop
   messages, they may be able to inject packets faster than the
   correspondants, and thus beat legitimate packets in a race.

   As summarised, there are three broad variations of the MITM attacker:

   1.  An on-path attacker that can view, delete and modify messages.
       This is the Dolev-Yao attack.

   2.  An off-path attacker that can view messages and insert new
       messages.

   3.  An off-path attacker that can only view messages.

2.  Three kinds of attack

   The attacks are numbered in this section as no consensus on naming
   the attacks yet.  In the diagrams below, the sender is named "Alice",
   and the recipient is named "Bob", as is typical in many cryptographic
   protocols [alicebob], as first introduced by [digisign].

   The attacker is named "Mallory"

   .-------.                   .-----.
   | Alice |------------------>| Bob |
   '-------'                   '-----'

                   Figure 1: Alice communicating with Bob

2.1.  First Kind of attack

   In this attack, the attacker is involved with the forwarding of the
   packets.  A firewall or network router is ideally placed for this
   attack.

   .-------.      ***********       .-----.
   | Alice |------* Mallory *------>| Bob |
   '-------'      ***********       '-----'

                     Figure 2: The first kind of attack

   In this case Mallory can:

   *  view all packets

   *  selectively forward or drop any packet

Internet-Draft                    MITM                      January 2021


   *  modify any packets that is forwarded

   *  insert additional packets

2.2.  Second Kind of attack

   In this attack, the attacker is not involved with the forwarding of
   the packets.  The attacker receives a copy of packets that are sent.
   This could be from, for instance, a mirror port or SPAN [span].
   Alternatively, a copy of traffic may be obtained via passive
   (optical) tap [fibertap].

   .-------.                        .-----.
   | Alice |---------.------------->| Bob |
   '-------'         |              '-----'
                     v
                ***********
                * Mallory *
                ***********

                    Figure 3: The second kind of attack

   In this case Mallory can:

   *  view all packets

2.3.  Second Kind of attack with bypass

   In some cases, Mallory may be able to send messages to Bob via
   another route which due to some factor will arrive at Bob prior to
   the original message from Alice.

   .-------.                  .->--.    .-----.
   | Alice |---------------|  |    |  .>| Bob |
   '-------'     |         |  |    |  | '-----'
                 |         |  |    v  |     ^
                 |         |  |    |  |     |
                 v         '-->    '->|     |
            ***********                     |
            * Mallory *---------------------'
            ***********

              Figure 4: The second kind of attack with bypass

   In that case Mallory can:

   *  view all packets

   *  insert additional/copied packets into the stream

   But Mallory will be unable to drop or modify the original packets.
   Bob however, may be unable to distinguish packets from Alice vs
   packets sent from Mallory that purport to be from Alice.

2.4.  Third Kind of attack

   The third kind of attack is one in which Mallory can not see any
   packets from Alice.  This is usually what is meant by an "off-path"
   attack.  Mallory can usually forge packets purporting to be from
   Alice, but can never see Alice's actual packets.

   .-------.                            .-----.
   | Alice |--------------------------->| Bob |
   '-------'                            '-----'
                                            ^
                                            |
                                            |
            ***********                     |
            * Mallory *---------------------'
            ***********

                     Figure 5: The third kind of attack

   In this case Mallory can:

   *  insert additional packets

3.  Three proposals on terminology

   This document aspires to pick a single set of terms and explain them.

3.1.  QUIC terms

   [quic] ended up with a different taxonomy:

   *  nn-path [Dolev-Yao]

   *  Limited on-path (cannot delete)

   *  Off-path

3.2.  Malory/Man in various places

   [malory] proposes:

   *  man-in-the-middle [Dolev-Yao]

Internet-Draft                    MITM                      January 2021


   *  man-on-the-side

   *  man-in-the-rough

   Alternatively:

   *  Malory-in-the-middle [Dolev-Yao]

   *  Malory-on-the-side

   *  Malory-in-the-rough

3.3.  Council of Attackers

   [alliteration] proposes the "the council of attackers"

   *  malicious messenger [Dolev-Yao: who rewrites messages sent]

   *  oppressive observer [who uses your information against you]

   *  off-path attacker

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a set of terminology that will be used in
   many Security Considerations sections.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no IANA requests.
